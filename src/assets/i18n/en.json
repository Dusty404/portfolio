During my time in the military, I started exploring C++ on my own and was amazed by how a few lines of code could bring something to life from nothing. Today, I know that programming offers endless possibilities. It's a continuous journey of learning and discovery. That’s why I’ve made it my goal to learn as much as I can about coding – and to apply that knowledge in real projects. \nLet’s build something amazing together!"
